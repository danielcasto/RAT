# About
The current method for processing MRI images to isolate regions of interest of rat brains
requires manual annotations on each individual image. As the number of subjects and images
increases, this process becomes increasingly costly and inefficient. A software solution is
necessary to reduce the processing time. This project seeks to be that solution, leveraging 
an existing atlas, a map of regions of interest, to segment rat brain MRIs autonomously. This
user-friendly interface will allow selecting a group of images for processing and a set of regions
of interest, and a background task will create a binary mask for each of the selected regions of
interest that is exported on completion. Overall, this software solution will require significantly
less manual work and greatly reduce time that is takes to annotate MRIs.
